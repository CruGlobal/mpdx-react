The foregoing obligation does not apply to any Action or Losses arising out of or relating to any of the following:
      12.1.1. access to or use of the Licensed Software, Services or Cru Materials in combination with any hardware, system, software, network or other materials or service not provided or authorized in writing by Cru;

      12.2.2. act, omission or other matter relating to Licensee Data or Personal Data or as described in Section 8, whether or not the same results in any Action against or Losses by any Cru Indemnitee;
      12.2.3. any other materials or information (including any documents, data, specifications, software, content or technology) provided by or on behalf of Licensee or any Authorized User, including Cru’s compliance with any specifications or directions provided by or on behalf of Licensee or any Authorized User to the extent prepared without any contribution by Cru;
      12.2.4. Licensee’s breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or obligations under this Agreement; or
      12.2.5. negligence or more culpable act or omission by Licensee, any Authorized User, or any third party on behalf of Licensee or any Authorized User, in connection with this Agreement.
   12.3. Indemnification Procedure.
      12.3.1. Each Party shall promptly notify the other Party in writing of any Action for which such Party believes it is entitled to be indemnified pursuant to Section 13.1 or Section 13.2, as the case may be.  The Party seeking indemnification (the “Indemnitee”) shall cooperate with the other Party (the “Indemnitor”) at the Indemnitor’s sole cost and expense.  The Indemnitor shall immediately take control of the defense and investigation of such Action and shall employ counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee to handle and defend the same, at the Indemnitor’s sole cost and expense.  The Indemnitee’s failure to perform any obligations under this Section 12.3 will not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations under this Section 12, except to the extent that the Indemnitor can demonstrate that it has been prejudiced as a result of such failure.  The Indemnitee may participate in and observe the proceedings at its own cost and expense with counsel of its own choosing.
      12.3.2. For any indemnity obligations of Cru under Section 12.1 arising from qualifying Actions for copyright infringement made against the Licensee for use, licensing, or of the Licensed Software, Cru shall have the right, in Cru’s sole discretion, to control the defense of such action including choosing counsel. Licensee agrees to cooperate with Cru in any such action.  All out-of-pocket expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, expert witness fees, and court costs, related to Cru’s participation in such infringement action shall be borne solely by Cru.
      12.3.3. Notwithstanding the indemnity obligation, prior to entering into any settlement or commencing or engaging in any litigation or suit that involves any Licensed Software, Licensee shall obtain Cru’s approval to enter into such settlement or commence or engage in such litigation.  Cru shall cooperate with Licensee or join in any such action at Licensee’s reasonable request and expense.  All out-of-pocket expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, expert witness fees, and court costs, related to Cru’s participation in such infringement action at the request of Licensee, shall be borne solely by Licensee.

Licensee shall have no right to obligate Cru in any way or cause anything to have a negative impact on Cru or be a disadvantage to Cru in any such litigation.
   12.4. Mitigation.  If any of the Licensed Software, or Cru Materials are the subject of,  or, are deemed to have misappropriated or otherwise violated any third party Intellectual Property Right, or if Licensee’s or any Authorized User’s use of the Services or Cru Materials is enjoined or threatened to be enjoined, Cru may, at its option and sole cost and expense:
      12.4.1. obtain the right for Licensee to continue to use the Licensed Software, Services and Cru Materials materially as contemplated by this Agreement;
      12.4.2. modify or replace the Licensed Software, Services and Cru Materials, in whole or in part, to seek to make the Licensed Software, Services and Cru Materials (as so modified or replaced) non-infringing, while providing materially equivalent features and functionality, in which case such modifications or replacements will constitute Services and Cru Materials, as applicable, under this Agreement; or
      12.4.3. by written notice to Licensee, terminate this Agreement and require Licensee to immediately cease any use of the Services and Cru Materials.


THIS SECTION 12 SETS FORTH LICENSEE’S SOLE REMEDIES AND CRU’S SOLE LIABILITY AND OBLIGATION FOR ANY ACTUAL, THREATENED OR ALLEGED CLAIMS THAT THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF (INCLUDING THE LICENSED SOFTWARE AND ANY CRU SERVICES AND CRU MATERIALS) INFRINGES, MISAPPROPRIATES OR OTHERWISE VIOLATES ANY THIRD PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT.

Any award, or portion of any award, recovered by Cruin any such action or proceeding commenced by Cru shall belong solely to Cru after recovery by both parties of their respective actual out-of-pocket costs.

The parties hereby agree to cooperate with each other in the conduct or defense of any legal action, and in the negotiations in respect of any legal action relating to any of the Licensed Software and related Intellectual Property Rights, and each will provide to the other all relevant data, information and material in its possession which may be helpful in such action or negotiation, at the cost and expense of the party requesting such data, information and material.
   14.3. Licensee shall have no right to obligate Cru in any way or cause anything to have a negative impact on Cru or be a disadvantage to Cru by virtue of the entitlement conveyed above.  In the event Licensee fails to act in accordance with this section, the License herein granted to Licensee shall forthwith become voidable and Cru shall have the right to sue for infringement at Cru’s own expense and to collect for its own use all damages, profits, and awards of whatever nature recoverable for such infringement.

________________


Software License Agreement
Exhibit B - Statement of Faith


The sole basis of our beliefs is the Bible, God’s infallible written Word, the 66 books of the Old and New Testaments. We believe that it was uniquely, verbally and fully inspired by the Holy Spirit, and that it was written without error (inerrant) in the original manuscripts. It is the supreme and final authority in all matters on which it speaks.
We accept those areas of doctrinal teaching on which historically there has been general agreement among all true Christians. Because of the specialized calling of our movement, we desire to allow for freedom of conviction on other doctrinal matters, provided that any interpretation is based upon the Bible alone, and that no such interpretation shall become an issue which hinders the ministry to which God has called us.
1. There is one true God, eternally existing in three persons – Father, Son and Holy Spirit – each of whom possesses equally all the attributes of Deity and the characteristics of personality.
2. Jesus Christ is God, the living Word, who became flesh through His miraculous conception by the Holy Spirit and His virgin birth. Hence, He is the perfect Deity and true humanity united in one person forever.
3. He lived a sinless life and voluntarily atoned for the sins of men by dying on the cross as their substitute, thus satisfying divine justice and accomplishing salvation for all who trust in Him alone.
4. He rose from the dead in the same body, though glorified, in which He lived and died.
5. He ascended bodily into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God the Father, where He, the only mediator between God and man, continually makes intercession for His own.
6. Man was originally created in the image of God. He sinned by disobeying God; thus, he was alienated from his Creator. That historic fall brought all mankind under divine condemnation.
7. Man’s nature is corrupted, and he is thus totally unable to please God. Every man is in need of regeneration and renewal by the Holy Spirit.
8. The salvation of man is wholly a work of God’s free grace and is not the work, in whole or in part, of human works or goodness or religious ceremony. God imputes His righteousness to those who put their faith in Christ alone for their salvation, and thereby justifies them in His sight.
9. It is the privilege of all who are born again of the Spirit to be assured of their salvation from the very moment in which they trust Christ as their Savior. This assurance is not based upon any kind of human merit, but is produced by the witness of the Holy Spirit, who confirms in the believer the testimony of God in His written Word.
10. The Holy Spirit has come into the world to reveal and glorify Christ and to apply the saving work of Christ to men. He convicts and draws sinners to Christ, imparts new life to them, continually indwells them from the moment of spiritual birth and seals them until the day of redemption. His fullness, power and control are appropriated in the believer’s life by faith.
11. Every believer is called to live so in the power of the indwelling Spirit that he will not fulfill the lust of the flesh but will bear fruit to the glory of God.
12. Jesus Christ is the Head of the Church, His Body, which is composed of all men, living and dead, who have been joined to Him through saving faith.
13. God admonishes His people to assemble together regularly for worship, for participation in ordinances, for edification throughout the Scriptures and for mutual encouragement.
14. At physical death the believer enters immediately into eternal, conscious fellowship with the Lord and awaits the resurrection of his body to everlasting glory and blessing.
15. At physical death the unbeliever enters immediately into eternal, conscious separation from the Lord and awaits the resurrection of his body to everlasting judgment and condemnation.
16. Jesus Christ will come again to the earth–personally, visibly and bodily–to consummate history and the eternal plan of God.
17. The Lord Jesus Christ commanded all believers to proclaim the gospel throughout the world and to disciple men of every nation. The fulfillment of that Great Commission requires that all worldly and personal ambitions be subordinated to a total commitment to “Him who loved us and gave Himself for us.”
