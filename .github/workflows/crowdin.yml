            Update translations with the latest labels extracted from the components and downloaded from CrowdIn.

            Due to GitHub Actions restrictions, our `on: pull_request` CI workflow will not run automatically because this PR was created by a bot. To get it to run, a human will have to push a commit to the branch.

            ```sh
            $ git switch bot-update-translations
            $ git commit --allow-empty --message "Bump CI"
            $ git push
            ```
